# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Solving-Sudoku-In-C
main genetic algorithm loop is in ga.c and different types of crossovers and mutations are in ga_others.c \
unsolved sudoku board is generated by functions from previous project [link](https://github.com/werixx1/terminal-sudoku-in-c) that are in load_sudoku.c and utils.c \
execute: ```gcc main.c load_sudoku.c utils.c ga.c ga_others.c -o solve_sudoku``` then ```./solve_sudoku``` 

## • types of selections, crossovers and mutations in project:
&nbsp; - tournament_selection \
&nbsp; - roulette_selection \
&nbsp; - single_point_crossover \
&nbsp; - two_point_crossover \
&nbsp; - uniform_crossover \
&nbsp; - square_swap_mutation \
&nbsp; - random_reset_mutation 
<br>
<br>
**fitness** is number of conflicts (same numbers in row, column or square) the lowest number, the closer algorithm is to solution
(0 = no conflicts, solved sudoku)
